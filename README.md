- 👋 Hi, I’m Evan Kaminsky, @ekamins9
- 👀 I’m interested in programming of course, specifically software engineering, AI and machine learning. My favorite programming language is C++, and my least
favorite is PROLOG.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Rowan University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun and interesting projects, including cool software that automates stuff, always useful, video game design, and computers that 
can outsmart us humans. I want to do as many projects in different fields as I can in order to learn as much as possible, as real experience beats a classroom any day.
- 📫 If you want to reach out to me, feel free to shoot me an email at ekaminsky1337@gmail.com
