# Hey!
I'm Evan - a software engineer, musician, and cat dad.

I currently work as a software engineer on mission-critical, high-reliability systems at Amtrak- specifically their nationwide Train Control System that keeps millions of passengers moving safely every year. My work spans back-end engineering, full-stack development, and automation, with a focus on building scalable, reliable, and modern solutions.

Outside of work I like to play guitar and piano, make things, and recently I've been getting into making music via programming with Haskell. I also enjoy playing video games, watching anime and reading manga!

THE ONE PIECE IS REAL! 👒🍖☠︎︎
