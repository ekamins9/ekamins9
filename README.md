# Hey, I'm Evan  

Iâ€™m a SWE working on mission-critical, high-reliability systems at Amtrak - specifically their
nationwide Train Control System that keeps millions of passengers moving safely every year. 
My work spans back-end engineering, full-stack development, and automation, with a focus on 
building scalable, reliable, and modern solutions.

This GitHub is where I share my personal projects!
