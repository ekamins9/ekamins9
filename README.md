# Hey!
I'm Evan - a software engineer, musician, and cat dad.

I currently work as a software engineer on mission-critical, high-reliability systems at Amtrak- 
specifically their nationwide Train Control System that keeps millions of passengers moving 
safely every year. My work spans back-end engineering, full-stack development, and automation, 
with a focus on building scalable, reliable, and modern solutions.
