Nothing gets inserted into a Tool automatically — create `Config`, `Server` and `Client`
inside each weapon by hand. `CombatServer` / `CombatClient` live once, in the folders above.
Note `RigReplicator` and `LoadoutMenu` go in **StarterPlayerScripts** (not
StarterCharacterScripts): they must survive your respawns.

**Weapons now live in `ServerStorage` → `Weapons` (Folder)**, not StarterPack. The loadout
menu clones the chosen one into your Backpack when you spawn. Empty StarterPack, or
you'll spawn with two.

## Loadout menu (armor + weapon before you spawn)

`LoadoutServer` turns off `Players.CharacterAutoLoads`; nobody has a body until they
press SPAWN. The menu lists every set in `ServerStorage.Armor` and every Tool in
`ServerStorage.Weapons` with their stats (read from each one's `Config`), remembers your
last pick, and comes back 4 s after you die (the ragdoll gets its moment first).
Change `RESPAWN_MENU_DELAY` / `AUTO_EQUIP` at the top of `LoadoutServer`.

## Armor sets

```
ServerStorage
└─ Armor (Folder)
   └─ KnightSkin (Model or Folder — its name is the armor id)
      ├─ Config            ModuleScript (see below)
      ├─ HeadClothing      Model  ┐ each has a Part named Middle, the same size as
      ├─ TorsoClothing     Model  │ the limb it dresses, plus any other parts built
      ├─ LeftArmClothing   Model  │ around it. Any slot may be missing (a peasant
      ├─ RightArmClothing  Model  │ has no HeadClothing → bare head, full damage).
      ├─ LeftLegClothing   Model  │
      └─ RightLegClothing  Model  ┘
```

On equip, `Middle` is welded exactly onto the limb and every other part is welded at the
offset it had from `Middle` in the template — build the set on a dummy in place and it
lands the same way on the player. All pieces end up massless, non-colliding, `Middle`
invisible, inside `Character.Armor`. Each clothing model gets a `Limb` attribute
(`"Head"`, `"Left Arm"`, …) so other systems can find it.

`Config` (only list what differs from `Armor.DEFAULTS`):

```lua
return {
	Name        = "Knight Skin",
	Description = "A beautiful shiny suit of armor, worn only by the finest of knights.",
	Type        = "Heavy",   -- Light | Medium | Heavy (badge + menu order)
	Health      = 50,        -- added to MaxHealth
	SpeedMult   = 0.75,      -- WalkSpeed multiplier → SpeedMult_Armor
	ClunkMult   = 1.8,       -- footstep weight → ClunkMult_Armor
	Protection  = 0.35,      -- 35% less damage on limbs this set covers
}
```

Rules the sets play by:
- **Protection is per limb.** A hit only gets the reduction if that limb has a clothing
  model on it. No helmet = full head damage (and heads already take `HEAD_DAMAGE_MULT`).
  Hits on hats/clothing count as the limb underneath.
- A face-stab execute still kills through any helmet (it's a finisher, not a damage roll).
- Severed limbs take their armor with them; a skewered head takes its helmet onto the blade.
- Helmets (`HeadClothing`) are hidden in first person like hats.
- Test dummies wear whatever you're wearing; `/spawn attack Pitchfork PeasantSkin`
  picks a weapon and set, `/spawn attack Pitchfork none` strips it.

## Making a new weapon

Duplicate the Pitchfork tool's three scripts into the new Tool and edit **only `Config`**:
animations, `ATTACKS` (each with `kind = "slash"` or `"stab"`), `CYCLE_ORDER`, `REACH`,
`SPEED_MULT`, `TWO_HANDED`, its weight (`SpeedMult` / `ClunkMult`, 1 = no effect) and
`SOUNDS`. Any key from `CombatServer.DEFAULTS` or `CombatClient.DEFAULTS` can be overridden
there too (e.g. `PARRY_WINDOW`, `HEAD_DAMAGE_MULT`, `KEYS`, `TRAIL_COLOR`).

The Tool needs a box `Part` named `Hitbox` whose longest axis runs along the blade.
Optional: a `workspace.NPCs` folder of humanoid models — kicks, ragdoll, and bleeding
work on them too.

## Controls (all rebindable in the ⚙ on the spawn menu; right mouse is always block)

**LMB swing · scroll up stab · scroll down overhead · X underhand** — hold **LeftAlt** for the
left-side version (default side Right; both are settings) · **Q feint** · RMB block (feint-to-parry
during windup) · G kick (works unarmed too) · LeftShift sprint (forward / forward-diagonal only) ·
Space dodge (a ~2-stud sidestep, side or back, 10 stamina) · LeftControl/C crouch · **Z first /
third person** (no scroll zoom any more) · V pick up a weapon · Tab leaderboard. **There is no
jumping.** Walking backwards is 35% slower and sideways 20% slower — dodge to reposition fast.

Binds take keys, left / middle mouse, scroll up / down. Roblox does not expose Mouse 4 / 5 to
games — bind them to a key in your mouse software (e.g. Mouse4 → X) and bind that key here.

## Attack input: sides, modifier, scroll wheel

Four inputs — **Swing, Stab, Overhead, Underhand** — each with a left and a right version. Which
side you get is a setting (⚙ → Keybinds → *Attack side*):

- **Modifier** (default): always your *Default side* (Right); hold the *Opposite side* key
  (LeftAlt) for the other.
- **Mouse**: the way your mouse was moving when you pressed. Still mouse = alternate. The
  Opposite-side key flips whatever the flick gave you.

## Attack animations, morphs and combos

`anim` is **one clip of wind-up + swing** (0.1 s + 0.3 s in every current weapon) and
`FIT_ANIMS` stretches it to `windup + active`, so the clip's wind-up part *is* the windup
phase at whatever tempo the weapon runs. Recovery is a hold after the clip ends. Optional
two-clip form: `windupAnim` (idle → loaded pose) fits `windup`, `anim` (swing only) fits
`active`. Every phase time divides by `speed × SPEED_MULT`, so tune a weapon's overall tempo
with `SPEED_MULT` and a single attack's with its `speed`.

- **Morph** — a different attack pressed during the **windup**: the new attack's wind-up
  plays over whatever windup is left, then its swing.
- **Combo** — a different attack pressed during the **swing** (active): when this swing ends,
  the next attack goes **straight into its swing** — no second wind-up, no recovery between.
- Same attack twice is neither (denied).

Attack names: `LeftSwing`, `RightStab`, `LeftOverhead`, `RightUnderhand`… or plain `Stab` /
`Overhead` for an unsided one; a sided version wins over the plain one once it exists.

## Combat rules 2 (the fencing layer)

- **Morph**: press a different attack during your windup (right swing → stab…) to switch to it.
  `MORPH_COST` stamina, `MORPHS_PER_SWING` per swing, not past `MORPH_CUTOFF` of the windup; the
  new attack keeps at least `MORPH_MIN_WINDUP` × its own windup. The windup animation swaps too.
- **Chamber**: start the same *kind* of attack (stab vs strike) while theirs is coming, facing
  them, within `CHAMBER_WINDOW` of your windup start — their swing dies (`CHAMBER_STUN` on them),
  yours releases at once. Sparks + the white edge flash mean you got it.
- **Flinch only in windup** (`FLINCH_ONLY_WINDUP`): a hit stops a swing that hasn't committed;
  one already in release finishes. Trading is a choice now. Kicks still stop anything.
- **Stamina**: a swing that touches nothing costs `MISS_COST_MULT` × its cost extra; a clean hit
  refunds `HIT_REFUND`. A dodge that makes a swing miss you refunds `DODGE_REFUND`.
- **Per-region damage**: `damage` is a number (× `HEAD_DAMAGE_MULT` / `LEG_DAMAGE_MULT`) or
  `{head=, body=, legs=}`.
- **Animations fit the rules** (`FIT_ANIMS`): each attack's optional `windupAnim` is stretched to
  its windup, the release anim to active+recovery — so a morph, riposte or chamber re-times what
  you see. Attack names are `<Side><Type>` (see a weapon Config).
- A whiffed kick recovers `KICK_MISS_EXTRA` longer. Spawn protection: a `ForceField` for
  `SPAWN_PROTECT` s (LoadoutServer); attacking, kicking or blocking ends it early.

## Rounds

`RoundServer`: free-for-all, `ROUND_LENGTH` (5 min) → top killer wins → `INTERMISSION` (15 s)
with everyone pulled out and the leaderboard forced open → stats reset, everyone re-enters
through the loadout menu. State lives on `ReplicatedStorage.Round` (`State`, `TimeLeft`, `Number`,
`Winner`). The timer is top-centre; SPAWN waits during an intermission.

## Voice

Put a folder `Voice` in `SoundService` with subfolders `Swing`, `Hurt`, `Death`, `Kick`, `Parry`,
each holding any number of `Sound`s — one is picked at random (its own Volume/PlaybackSpeed are
the baseline). Missing folders are silent.

## Movement (MovementServer + Movement)

Numbers live in `ReplicatedStorage.MovementConfig`. The server publishes `SpeedMult_Sprint`
and `SpeedMult_Facing` from replicated state (MoveDirection, attributes), so the client can
only ever *ask*. Sprint ends the moment you block, crouch, attack, get stunned or ragdoll.
Dodge: the client pushes itself (it owns its physics, `DODGE_SPEED` for `DODGE_TIME`) and the
server validates and charges `DODGE_COST` stamina; forward input is stripped, no input = hop back.

## Weapons on the floor (Pickup)

A weapon that leaves a hand — disarm, death, or a swap — lands as a pickup with a prompt (hold
V) in `workspace.DroppedWeapons`, for `DESPAWN` seconds. Slots: **one primary + one secondary**
(a weapon whose `Config` has `SECONDARY = true`), `MAX_WEAPONS` total; taking a weapon for a full
slot drops what was in it right there. The loadout menu offers a secondary list from the same
flag. Switch weapons with the Roblox backpack (1 / 2).

## Skewered heads

A **lethal** face stab (no more auto-execute — `STAB_HEAD_EXECUTE` is off) hangs the victim's
head on your blade, sitting exactly on its axis. It stays there until your next swing, then flies
off forward at `HEAD_THROW_SPEED`: `HEAD_THROW_DAMAGE` and a `HEAD_THROW_STUN` on whoever it
hits (it can finish someone low). Unequipping just drops it.

## Kill feed + leaderboard

`Scoreboard` keeps `leaderstats` (Kills, Deaths) per player and fires a kill-feed entry on every
death. Credit: CombatServer stamps `LastHitBy` / `LastHitWith` / `LastHitKind` on a character
each time it hurts it (swings, kicks, thrown heads); a death within `CREDIT_WINDOW` (15 s) of
the last hit counts for that attacker, a bleed-out included. **Hold Tab** for the board (kills,
deaths, K/D, sorted by kills; replaces Roblox's list). Dummies show in the feed, not the board.

## Settings (⚙ on the spawn menu)

Camera feel sliders (head bob, weapon sway, camera roll, impact shake, breathing, first-person
clunk boost, FP FOV — 0 turns an effect off, for competitive play) and keybinds. Stored in
`ReplicatedStorage.ClientSettings`, read live by CameraRig / CombatClient / Movement, and
saved per player by `SettingsServer` (DataStore; in Studio enable *Allow Studio access to API
services* or it just lasts the session).

## Test dummies (chat)

`/spawn idle` · `/spawn block` · `/spawn parry` · `/spawn attack` · `/spawn clear` — spawns an
R6 dummy holding the `Greatsword` (from `ServerStorage.Weapons`) 8 studs in front of you,
facing you, wearing your armor. `/spawn <mode> <WeaponName> [ArmorId|none]` picks
different gear. Attack dummies really hit and parry dummies really parry: their weapon
runs the combat module in NPC mode (server-side animation + server-side blade sweep).
Change `WEAPON_NAME` in `TestDummies` for another default weapon.

## Combat rules (Mordhau-ish)

- **Phases**: windup → release (blade live) → recovery. All scale with `SPEED_MULT`.
- **Physical blocking**: while holding RMB your weapon's `GuardHull` is raycast-visible.
  The incoming blade must touch it *before* a body part (a body hit whose point lies inside
  the hull also counts), and you must face the attacker within `BLOCK_CONE_DEG`.
  From behind / off-side / under the guard = clean hit.
- **Parry**: block raised within `PARRY_WINDOW` → attacker stunned, you get a riposte
  (`RIPOSTE_SPEED` tempo for `RIPOSTE_DURATION`). Re-tapping block spams no new windows.
- **Feint**: RMB during windup cancels the attack into a block (`FEINT_COST`).
- **Combo**: press a *different* attack during release/recovery to chain it, skipping recovery.
- **Kick (G)**: unblockable, staggers a held block. Needs your right leg.
- **Leg hits** deal damage only — they no longer knock you down.
- **Crouch (LeftControl)**: torso drops `CROUCH_DROP`, `SpeedMult_Crouch` slows you. Other
  players see it, so ducking under a high swing or leaning back from a stab is a real dodge.
- **Stamina** (`BlockMeter`): attacks, feints, kicks, blocks drain it. Hits 0 from a
  block → guard break stun. Guard hit while already at 0 → **weapon flies out of your hand**.
- **Head**: `HEAD_DAMAGE_MULT` × damage (2× by default) — no automatic kill.
- **Kills**: a lethal **slash** severs the limb it hit (arm, leg, or head → decapitation);
  with `BLEED_OUT_CHANCE` an arm/leg victim survives on `BLEED_HP` and bleeds out instead.
  A lethal **stab** leaves the weapon run through the body (`IMPALE`) until the corpse despawns.
  Lose the right arm → weapon dropped, can't wield. Lose the left arm → dropped only if
  `TWO_HANDED`. Trying to block one-armed flings the weapon. Each lost leg multiplies speed
  by `LEG_SPEED` and clunk by `LEG_CLUNK`.
- **Ragdoll**: leg hits knock you down for `KNOCKDOWN_TIME`; death ragdolls for good.
- **Death cam**: first person from inside your head wherever it rolls, then fade to black.
- **Disarmed weapons** land as real pickups; walk over one to grab it (after 2s).

## Pose replication

`CameraRig` computes your body pose (aim bend, lean, bob, kick, crouch, arm sway) with
`RigPose` and sends the 9 inputs ~20×/s over `PoseRemote` (an UnreliableRemoteEvent).
`PoseRelay` forwards them to every other player; their `RigReplicator` runs the same
`RigPose` math on your character, smoothed. Nothing is applied on the server. Pose shape
constants (`NECK_PITCH`, `CROUCH_DROP`, `KICK_ANGLE`, …) live in `RigPose.CONFIG` so
everyone renders the same body.

## Debug flags (live, no code changes)

Attributes on `ReplicatedStorage.Debug` — created automatically at startup. Toggle in
Studio via Properties → Attributes, or from the F9 console:

```lua
-- Server tab: everyone sees it. Client tab: only you (fine for Rays).
game.ReplicatedStorage.Debug:SetAttribute("Rays", true)
```

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `Logs` | true | `print()` chatter from combat scripts |
| `Rays` | false | draw blade sweep rays (green miss / red hit) |
| `GuardHull` | true | show the block hull around weapons (brighter while blocking) |
| `Hitbox` | false | show weapon `Hitbox` parts |
| `TurnCap` | false | print when the camera turn cap engages |

## Sound slots

Per weapon, in `Config.SOUNDS`: `Equip`, `Swing`, `Hit`, `Block`, `Parry`, `Kick`, `KickHit` —
these default to Roblox built-in `rbxasset://` content so combat is audible immediately.
Only list slots you've filled: an `rbxassetid://0` entry overrides the default with silence.
Global, in `SoundConfig`: `Footstep`, `Heartbeat`, `Death`, `Dismember`, `Impale`,
`Bleed`, `Disarm`, `Pickup`, `Dodge`, `HeadThrow`, `BodyFall` (these are still mostly `rbxassetid://0`, i.e. silent).

**Footsteps by material:** put a folder named `FootstepSounds` in `SoundService`
(or `ReplicatedStorage`) containing one `Sound` per `Enum.Material` name — `Grass`,
`Slate`, `Metal`, `Wood`, `Sand`, … plus an optional `Default`. `CameraRig` fires one
of these per step (the stepped clunk drives the timing, so they're one-shots rather
than loops) and falls back to `SoundConfig.Footstep` if the folder isn't there. Each
sound's own `Volume` and `PlaybackSpeed` are used as the baseline, then scaled by
step weight. Roblox's built-in looping `Running` sound is removed automatically.

## Movement modifiers (composable)

Anything that scales speed or footstep clunk writes **one attribute per source** on the
character and clears it (`nil`) when done. Consumers multiply every attribute with the
prefix, so sources stack and never overwrite each other:

```lua
character:SetAttribute("SpeedMult_Armor", 0.7)   -- plate armor: 30% slower
character:SetAttribute("ClunkMult_Armor", 1.8)   -- …and 80% heavier steps
character:SetAttribute("SpeedMult_Armor", nil)   -- unequip
```

| Attribute | Set by |
|---|---|
| `SpeedMult_Weapon`, `ClunkMult_Weapon` | CombatServer (from the weapon `Config`) |
| `SpeedMult_Swing` | CombatServer while attacking or kicking |
| `SpeedMult_Crouch` | PoseRelay while crouched |
| `SpeedMult_Limbs`, `ClunkMult_Limbs` | Injury, per lost leg |
| `SpeedMult_Armor`, `ClunkMult_Armor` | Loadout `Armor` (from the set's `Config`) |
| `SpeedMult_Sprint`, `SpeedMult_Facing` | MovementServer (sprint; backpedal/strafe penalty) |
| bare `SpeedMult` / `ClunkMult` | you, by hand in Properties, for testing |

## Other character attributes

| Attribute | Set by | Read by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Blocking`, `BlockStoppedAt`, `ParryUntil`, `BlockMeter`, `BlockMax`, `StunnedUntil`, `FastUntil` | CombatServer | CombatServer (other players' tools), HUD | combat state; `BlockMeter` is stamina |
| `Crouching` | PoseRelay | anything | holding crouch |
| `Acting` | CombatServer / MovementServer | MovementServer, CharacterSystems | mid-attack or mid-kick (no dodge, no sprint, no regen) |
| `StaminaRegen`, `StaminaRegenDelay` | CombatServer (weapon `Config`) | CharacterSystems | stamina regen now runs per character, weapon or not |
| `Dropped` (on a Tool) | Pickup | Pickup | the weapon is on the floor |
| `LocalDodgeAt`, `LocalDodgeX/Z` | Movement | CameraRig | dodge lean/roll |
| `LastDodgeAt`, `DodgeRefundTick` | MovementServer / CombatServer | CombatServer, HUD | dodge timing (server clock); refund cue |

| `LastHitBy/ByName/With/Kind/At` | CombatServer | Scoreboard | kill credit |
| `ArmorId`, `ArmorType`, `ArmorProtection`, `BaseMaxHealth` | Loadout `Armor` | CombatServer, TestDummies | worn set; protection applies only to covered limbs |
| `LimbLost_LeftArm` … `LimbLost_Head`, `Bleeding`, `BleedDPS` | Injury | CombatServer, InjuryFX, HUD | injuries; a bandage system clears `Bleeding` |
| `KnockedDownUntil` | Ragdoll | Ragdoll | knockdown timer |
| `HitTick`, `HitDir` | CombatServer | CameraRig, InjuryFX | victim feedback (flinch, flash) |
| `TurnCapUntil` | CombatServer | server only | **server clock** — never compare on the client |

| `LocalKickAt`, `LocalKickRise` | CombatClient | CameraRig | procedural leg kick |
| `LocalImpactAt`, `LocalImpactKind` | CombatClient | CameraRig | attacker feedback (impact kick) |
